What we request is to write make hackernews beautiful. Really beautiful.

● You can fetch the HN data from the API and use SASS, LESS, Stylus or
whatever, the important thing is that the code is clean, consistent and crystal
clear.
● The website needs to be implemented using JS framework of your choice (React is
preferred but you can use any other framework of your choice)
● code block below

What are we going to look for?
* Clear, concise, DRY implementation
* Appropriate naming conventions
* Automated tests on your frontend.
* We are **not** going to check the submitted script for syntax errors:
* Please use gitrepo to submit your coding challenge.
* We know that there are multiple online solutions already available but we would prefer to see
your approach on this and how you usually plan and do your work on a real world project.
